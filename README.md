# esp8266_ping_led

Show the status of internet connection in esp8266 using two LEDs

Here I used a NodeMCU
It displays ping value in serial monitor 
Also if the ping goes below 900ms an led indicates it.
Also if it is online(Good ping) it turns on another LED .
You can add multiple LEDs for multiple ping levels.
